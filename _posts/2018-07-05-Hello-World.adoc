This is the first post of my new personal blog, where I will briefly present myself and the purpose of this blog.

I am a Portuguese student currently taking the Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. You can find more information about me and what I do here: http://gustavosilva.me[gustavosilva.me]

At the moment, I have some ideas ready to be published related to my recent _hacktivities_. After that, I will either let it die or write about whatever crosses my mind.
